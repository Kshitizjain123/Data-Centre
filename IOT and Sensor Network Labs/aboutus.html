        <p class="mx-3  text-center" style="font-family:serif">Internet of Things (IoT) is research lab at Amity Institute of Information Technology, Amity University Uttar Pradesh, Noida India. IoT Lab is a research platform exploring the potential of crowdsourcing and Internet of Things for multidisciplinary research with more end-user interactions. The future of IoT research will require closer interactions between the researchers and the society in order to better address societal needs and challenges, including end-user acceptance. This will require new approaches for experimentation that will become more pervasive, leaking out from the labs into the real world. IoT Lab will serve this future by contributing to pave the way to new experimental approaches.  </p></div> 
        
        <p class="mx-5 my-5  animated fadeIn" style="font-family:serif">The IoT lab aims at addressing the following factors for making the IoT education and research contributing to development at large. Objectives of the proposed lab are listed below- <br><br>

1.	To spread the IoT among the students/researchers and to create a competitive industry required IoT skill in them.<br>
2.	Our main focus is to develop a well-equipped laboratory that will support researcher providing facilities to be compatible with the outside world in the areas of IoT.<br>
3.	To provide solutions to unsolved problems in the area of IoT to industry & Academia. <br>
